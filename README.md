> A live tuning tool for Forza Horizon 6 on PC.
Neptune connects to the running game and lets you change how your car behaves
while you drive: torque delivery, boost and ride height.

## Features

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Engine** | Reshape the torque curve by dragging it, set a torque multiplier and rev limit, tune a live RPM/throttle cam profile, hold anti-lag on a key to build boost off the line, and build extra boost while the game's own launch control holds you. |
| **Turbo** | Boost ceiling, extra torque, spool behaviour, synthetic lag, per-gear boost, a boost map you can shape per engine speed, and a scramble button for a burst of boost on demand. |
| **Suspension** | Set ride height per axle as a percentage, and drop the car on a key press with a smooth ramp, or bounce it between two heights. Manual lowrider hydraulics — hop an axle, a side or a single corner, hold a front/back/left/right down pose, or slam all four up or down, each bindable to its own key. Camber, track width and toe, per wheel or mirrored per axle, with camber optionally shifting to its own values whenever air ride drops. Warns when a car's rear axle or tires won't respond to these. |
| **DYNO** | New read-only dyno setup with selectable output units, torque/power graph, peak figures, live channels, engine details, an optional Graph/Numbers overlay, Dragy runs and the Boost Gauge in one place. |
| **Car** | Shows which car you’re currently in, along with a preview of the car and how it’s aspirated.. |
| **Tunes** | Save your engine and turbo setup per car and switch between saved tunes with one key while driving. |
| **Presets** | Save and reload whole setups. |
| **Settings** | Units, display and startup behaviour. |

Anti-lag, launch control, air ride, hydraulics, scramble and tune switching can
each be bound to a key, a controller button or a racing-wheel button, on their
own tab. A control only ever drives one feature — binding one that is already
in use takes it from whatever held it.

Every setting has a **?** next to it. Hover or click it for an explanation of
what that control does.

## Download

Grab the latest `Neptune.exe` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/DVS-code/Neptune/releases/latest).

Start the game and drive out into the world, then run Neptune. It needs to run
**as administrator** to talk to the game, and will ask for that on launch.

Windows may warn about an unrecognised app, because the build is not
code-signed. Each release ships a `SHA256SUMS.txt` you can check against.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Forza Horizon 6 on PC (Steam or Microsoft Store)
- Python 3.11 or newer, if running from source

## Running from source

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m neptune.app
```
> [!WARNING]
> Run your terminal as administrator, or Neptune will not be able to attach.

## Building a single executable

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller neptune.spec
```

The result is `dist/Neptune.exe`.

## Where your data is kept

Tunes, presets and settings are written to a `data` folder next to the
executable, so you can move the whole folder to another machine and keep them.
If that location is not writable, Neptune falls back to `%APPDATA%\Neptune`.

The exact path is shown at the bottom of the Settings tab.

## Notes

- Neptune reads and writes the game's memory only while you have it open. It
  makes no permanent changes to the game and installs nothing.
- Everything Neptune changes is put back when it closes. You can turn that off
  in Settings, and there is a **Restore everything** button at any time.

## Project layout

```
neptune/
  core/      module contract, registry, runtime loop, settings, storage
  memory/    process access, address table, pattern scanning
  vehicle/   car discovery, identity and live state
  ui/        theme, shell, reusable widgets
  features/  one file per tab
  utils/     some useful stuff
```

Adding a feature is one file in `features/` and one line in `app.py`.
