    `Wheels.CAMBER_SIN`/`CAMBER_COS` is a LIVE value the physics recomputes every
    tick by interpolating through this table against wheel travel — writing it
    directly gets overwritten almost immediately. This table is what the physics
    interpolates FROM, so writing it once (like a tuning-menu change would) sticks.

    Reached as wheel_base + PTR -> axle object + SUB -> the table itself. The front
    axle's two wheels (FL/FR) share one table object; the rear axle's (RR/RL) share
    another. Each table embeds TWO separate curves: the axle's left wheel reads
    entries starting at HEADER (+0x20), the right wheel reads a second, independent
    set of entries starting at SUB_B (+0xD40) — confirmed by decompiling the
    interpolation call site (the mirror argument is hardcoded there, not per-wheel)
    and by writing each region live and checking exactly one wheel moved, for both
    axles. Each of the ENTRY_COUNT entries is a 112-byte kinematic pose;
    CAMBER_SIN/CAMBER_COS within it is the same half-angle (sin, cos) pair as
    Wheels.CAMBER_SIN/CAMBER_COS, in both regions.

    TRACK_X/TRACK_X_B: two points per entry (wheel centre and, going by the offset
    gap, likely the contact patch) that always carry the SAME lateral (X) value —
    confirmed live, at every travel index sampled. That value flips sign between
    a wheel and its mirrored partner while the other axes stay identical (FL
    negative, FR positive), and it changes with travel (scrub), so this is track
    width baked into the same curve camber lives in — a delta from wherever this
    is now, not a target CAMBER_SIN/COS-style absolute (write-tested live: shifted
    a car's front track outward, restored it, no crash, camber untouched).
