"""Sound playback for feature modules.

Two very different jobs, so two classes:

  `OneShot`  — a short effect fired on an event (the air-ride release hiss). Uses QSoundEffect,
               which keeps the sample decoded in memory and can start instantly. WAV only.
  `Loop`     — a bed that plays continuously while a feature is enabled (the Maybach bounce track).
               Uses QMediaPlayer, which handles MP3 and can loop forever.

Both are deliberately FORGIVING: if the asset is missing, the audio backend is unavailable, or the
platform has no output device, every call turns into a no-op instead of raising. Sound is a garnish
on these features — a missing file must never stop the car from moving.

Qt objects must be created on the GUI thread. Playback is triggered from feature code that may be
running on the runtime thread, so `play()`/`start()` are safe to call from anywhere: they marshal
onto the owning thread with a queued invocation rather than touching the player directly.
